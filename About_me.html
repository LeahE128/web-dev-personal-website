                <p> I am a biotechnologist with a Double Honours BSc in Biology and Chemistry from Maynooth University (achieved a 2.1) and an MSc in Biotechnology from UCD (achieved a 1.1). The last two years I worked in a biotechnology company called Nuritas who combine AI and genomics to predict molecules in food that have a high probability of having health benefits. Working in Nuritas exposed me to the area of AI in the health tech industry and I discovered I had an interest in this area. I began an MSc in Computer Science in UCD this year with the aim of pursuing a role in the health tech field after completion. </p>

                <p>"Words will not be sufficient to describe the talent, dedication, efficiency and professionalism of my favourite associate scientist! I knew Leah when she joined Nuritas for an internship and when I got a chance to mentor her for a day, I knew that I will deeply regret if I don't get her to join my team!  When you are close to perfection you start reading your manager's thoughts. That's exactly my experience with Leah! she was reading my thoughts!. If you need an excellent, ambitious and a great team player, you know now who you should choose: Leah!"<br>- Dr Amine Zorgani</p>

                <p>"Throughout Leah's time at Nuritas she has shown a real scientific curiosity and great dedication to her work. This is especially true with the new projects she has been involved. It's really pleasing to see Leah's development as a scientist, quickly acquiring the necessary rigour and analytical skills. Leah has also consistently shown a genuine team ethic and willingness to learn. She has been a tremendous support to the lab, helping us to push the boundaries of scientific discovery."<br><br><br>- Dr Damian Crowley</p>

                <p>"I have the pleasure of working with Leah during her role as Microbiology Laboratory Technician with Nuritas. Leah is a fantastic colleague to work with, she is very diligent and takes great pride in her role. Her hard-working and very-organised attitude means she is a fast-learner which has made her a tremendous team member in the laboratory team. All these qualities and more will make her a perfect candidate for her next future role."<br><br><br><br>- Dr Alisha McLoughlin</p>
